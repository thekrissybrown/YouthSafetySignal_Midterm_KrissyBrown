## Purpose
This folder is designated for **integration testing** scripts that will verify multi-component workflows across the Flask app, database, and UI templates.

## Current Status
Integration tests have not been implemented at this stage.  
Database connectivity (MySQL) and full routing logic are scheduled for completion in November 2025.

## Planned Tools
- pytest + Flask testing client
- Selenium (for UI route validation)
- Postman or Insomnia (for API endpoint testing)

## Next Steps
- Establish database connection tests
- Simulate multi-user interactions (submit → review → approve)
- Validate data persistence and cross-route functionality

*Placeholder file for midterm submission. Integration testing to follow database deployment.*
